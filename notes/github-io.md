# Using GitHub to directly publish Markdown files

GitHub now allows direct publishing of markdown files [markdown files](https://blog.github.com/2016-12-09-publishing-with-github-pages-now-as-easy-as-1-2-3/).

It really is as simple as 1,2,3 but for more control, it's useful to know that the process still uses *jekyll* with the [primer](https://github.com/pages-themes/primer) theme.

It's possible to choose other themes, but for a small tweak on the default theme it's
possible to make changes. For this site I edited the `default.html` to show an image instead of a text title. The changes can be seen in these [lines](https://github.com/davegreenwood/davegreenwood.github.io/blob/6ec1c3dcb970522e96ddc6ba6500dbebd66885cd/_layouts/default.html#L15-L17).
